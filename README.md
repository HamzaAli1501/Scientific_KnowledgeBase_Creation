Introduction:
Getting authentic information has been quite difficult now-a-days due to large number os scams/ fake meta tags. The huge internet is useful if one knows how to use it for themselves. For a developer/ tech seeker, one would always consider relevant and up to date solutions for their queries, therefore they depends on getting that without wasting time in browsing through each links. Similarly, for newbies, they would get many links for their queries, each with relevant or fake meta tags, but they canâ€™t distinguish between the both. In both cases, they want a platform that can provide authentic and up to date solutions to their problems. They just need to provide the queries and relevant categories to our server, and let the server handles the rest, which would crawls the web and academic datasets for the solutions. Provided the case that if the solution could not be found, then the queries (with unique tokens) would be posted to our forums where our experts will answer it for them.
